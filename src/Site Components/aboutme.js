                Who am I? I'm a Full Stack Developer and a student at the
                University of British Columbia studying Computer Science. Most
                people know me for my creativity. I've been creating projects
                from a young age in different platforms. From the age of 9, I
                created and ran my own blog on WordPress, made a YouTube channel
                of lyric videos which would reach 50,000 views, created my own
                cartoon series using GoAnimate, wrote a mini book series, and
                have composed a dozen songs on the piano. In the recent years,
                my creativity has been focused on making my own apps and games
                using object-orientated programming as well as creating projects
                such as websites through scripting and front-end development.

                      My technical skills include language proficiency in Java,
                      C#, C++, JavaScript, CSS, and HTML. Knowledge in
                      frameworks include React and .NET, and I have experience
                      in both NoSQL databases such as MongoDB and SQL. My design
                      experience is very strong, evident through being the UI,
                      UX, and Graphic Designer for all of my individual and
                      collaborative projects, using Photoshop and Krita.

                      attention to detail, as well as being a fast learner.
                      Being on competitive volleyball and softball teams
                      throughout the years has taught me to be very comfortable
                      in collaborative settings and being a team player. My
                      leadership skills are evident through being a supervisor
                      and training new employees at my job as a Wine Sales
                      Representative.

                      I coded this website using JavaScript through React, HTML,
                      and CSS. It is implemented through Node.js as the open
                      source in Microsoft VS Code, and Github.io used to host
                      the site online. This was a challenging process for me
                      because I had to self-teach these languages, and it took a
                      while for me to become comfortable with them. However, it
                      was very rewarding and I absolutely loved the process!
